Demonstrate your ability to retrieve information from a database and display it.

For some environments, you may need to initialize your MySQL once before creating and populating the data. In
Cloud9, you do so via the command:
```
mysql-ctl start
```

You will need to create and populate the database before running this code. To do so, you will need to 
use either the command line or the MySQLAdmin tool. 

For instance, in Cloud9, here are the appropriate commands:

```
mysql-ctl cli
source book-complete.sql
```
